How am I impaired?
I have been a Lead Engineer at Thomson Reuters for about 9 years.  
I am on notice (since October 2017) from my employer for unacceptable performance (subject to immediate dismissal):
1) Not able to complete tasks in a timely fashion, including important deadlines
2) Poor quality of work causing delays and others to help
3) Not capable of multitasking
4) Poor communication e.g. reporting status
5) Lack of technical understanding

I have memory, cognitive, and anxiety issues.  I make lots of mistakes regarding emails and documents (reading, writing, finding).
I make lots of mistakes regarding the requirements, design, coding, compilation, testing, packaging, and documenting software.


My typical daily work activities:
I am expected to gather requirements, design, code, compile, test, package, and document software to support our market price products.  
I am also responsible for reproducing, debugging, and fixing production issues.  


How are my daily work activities impacted by my condition?
My work since January 2017 has been viewed as lower in expectation than that of a new hire.  
Prior to 2017 I have received satisfactory annual performance ratings.  I have difficulty staying focused and paying attention to details.  
Difficulty managing user names and passwords.  Difficulty managing information e.g. documents, emails, web pages etc..  
Difficulty resuming work after a few days off, e.g. which tasks have been completed, passed testing, or failed testing etc...  
Difficulty resuming work after my computer crashes or needs to be restarted for security or software updates.  
Difficulty following verbal and or written instructions e.g. installing and using new or updated software.
